//! This module provides functionality for encryption and decryption
//! using a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) client.
//!
//! The TEE client makes HTTP requests to a TEE server to perform
//! encryption and decryption operations. The main structures and
//! traits define the API and implementation for the TEE client.
